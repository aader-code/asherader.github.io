          I am a sophomore at The Browning School with strong interests in technology and problem-solving. I enjoy balancing rigorous academics with hands-on experiences through coding, robotics, debate, and competitive sports. I am particularly interested in learning how technology and design can be used to solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p class="large text-muted">
          I have experience in programming (Python, HTML, CSS), computer-aided design, and collaborative team environments through my involvement in clubs and varsity athletics. As a co-captain of the varsity indoor track and field team, I value leadership, discipline, and accountability, and I enjoy motivating others to perform at their best.

        <p class="large text-muted">
          Outside of school, I have participated in enrichment programs including the Robinhood.org Summer Program and the Boston University Pre-College Program, earning certificates from both. These experiences have strengthened my interest in learning beyond the classroom and exploring future academic and professional opportunities.
