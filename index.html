  <h1>Asher Ader</h1>
  <p><strong>New York, NY</strong></p>

  <p>
    I am a high school student at The Browning School with strong interests in
    technology, design, and problem-solving. I balance rigorous academics with
    hands-on experience through coding, robotics, debate, and varsity athletics.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have experience in Python, HTML, CSS, and computer-aided design, and I value
    leadership, discipline, and collaboration as a co-captain of the varsity indoor
    track and field team.
